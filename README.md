# Sentiment analysis using Skit-learn

This is a code for sentiment analysis on movie reviews using skit-learn.Just run sentiment_analysis_Skit-learn. But Before that download a dataset for the movie reviews. 
You can try kaggle for dataset on movie review. In This I have used a logistic regression model to check its accuracy.
The data set is divided into two halfs. One is training set which is used to train the model and the other one is testing which is used to test the accuracy of the model.
